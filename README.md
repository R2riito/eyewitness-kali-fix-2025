This repository documents my process of **replacing Gowitness** with the **latest EyeWitness v0.36.0** in my `recon.sh` script on Kali Linux, as part of hands-on penetration testing practice (inspired by the TCM PNPT course).

## ‚úÖ Summary

On May 4, 2025, I spent the day debugging and adapting my recon script to:

- Install and configure EyeWitness v0.36.0 on Kali
- Replace Gowitness in my recon.sh automation
- Solve Python dependency issues
- Manually compile geckodriver and fix PATH errors
- Make the screenshots + report generation work cleanly again

## üîÅ Changes Made to recon.sh

Here‚Äôs what I changed:

```bash

gowitness file -f "$subdomain_path/alive.txt" --screenshot-path "$screenshot_path"

# NEW EyeWitness command (inside /EyeWitness/Python folder)
cd ~/EyeWitness/Python
python3 EyeWitness.py --web -f "$subdomain_path/alive.txt" -d "$base_dir/output"
